This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

(2) By changing the rows per page or page we can view the other set of dog images.
(3) Clicking on the dog image we can view the dog details in the modal.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build:prod` or `yarn build:prod`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

We can build the application in different environments.
## `npm run build:staging` or `yarn build:staging`
## `npm run build:uat` or `yarn build:uat`

As of now we have only one environment (env). We can build the application in dev environment.
## `npm run build` or `yarn build`
