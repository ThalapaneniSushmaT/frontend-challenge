# :dog: Dogstagram frontend challenge
The goal of this exercise is to get an understanding of your code skills. 

## Challenge 
For this assignment, we want a simple application for dog lovers. 
Using the following api: https://thedogapi.com/ create an application that shows a list or a table of dog pictures.

## The requirements are as followed:
- The page is run using React.
- A user can get more info about the dog in the picture by click on the picture or with a 'see more' button.
- A user can filter based on dog breeds what dogs he gets shown.
- A user can favorite dog pictures.

## Nice to haves:
- Adding animations when pictures are favorited.
- The user can somehow see all the pictures he has favorited.
- The user can filter on more than just the dog breed.
- The application is hosted somewhere online and we can easily access it (preferably with a password). 
- Features that you thought of yourselve to show of your cool coding skills.

## Tips
- You can use any JS library to help with async requests / styling / state management etc.
- Please include clear instructions on how to start your application locally.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Features:
---------
(1) By default displaying the 5 dog images in the list.
(2) By changing the rows per page or page we can view the other set of dog images.
(3) Clicking on the dog image we can view the dog details in the modal.
(4) By toggling the favorite icon, we can add/remove dog picture as favorite.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build:prod` or `yarn build:prod`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

We can build the application in different environments.
## `npm run build:staging` or `yarn build:staging`
## `npm run build:uat` or `yarn build:uat`

As of now we have only one environment (env). We can build the application in dev environment.
## `npm run build` or `yarn build`
